I'm running a market garden and we farm grain and cattle. <br>
The reason im using github is to make an app <br>
where we can store and access data from any place <br>
on any device.<br>

I really like to read and we have 3 1/2 bookshelves full of books in our basement. People are generally appalled at the speed with which i read but that way i can read almost any given book any given amount of timesğŸ“šğŸ“šğŸ“š
